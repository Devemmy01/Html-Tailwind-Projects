                <p>Rabbits have been domesticated since Roman times, and possibly even from before that.</p>
                <p>Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae 
                    (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus
                     includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic
                      rabbit. Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. 
                      The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar
                       throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet.
                        With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world,
                     a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration.
                </p><br>
                <p>Rabbits really do breed like rabbits. The female is ready to breed almost
                     any time, and she’ll have a litter of babies about 30 days after breeding. 
                     These herbivores eat a diet of mostly green foods, but they are also opportunistic feeders
                      that will eat seeds, fruit, and bark.  
                    They live in large groups in underground tunnels called warrens with anything
                     from a few to dozens of roommates.

                <p>The scientific name for these animals depends on what kind of rabbit is being discussed.
                     In general, they belong to the order Lagomorpha and the family Leporidae, 
                     while the hare does not. Within that genus are dozens of rabbit names that include the
                     scientific name for the rabbit as a part of the classification.

                    <p>What is a pure line rabbit? Our common Knowledge on rabbits will tell us that 
                        a pure line is a rabbit showing all distinguishing features of a particular rabbits breed. For example
                        we could use a new Zealand white rabbit to sight an instance. By mere looks, a New zealand white
                        rabbit has a white, short and silky fur, albino eyes and long venous ears. This article will tell us more about <a href="purelinerabbit.html">...read more</a>
